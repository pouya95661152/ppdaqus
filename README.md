This repository contains a Python implementation of a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model based on an epsilon constraint for classifying flexible measures and identifying the most efficient Decision Making Units (DMUs) in the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). The model addresses limitations of traditional DEA approaches by incorporating flexible measures and ensuring all inputs, outputs, and flexible measures contribute to the efficiency evaluation process.
